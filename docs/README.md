## About
A (simple) program that'll automatically bulk rename and organise your **Movie and TV-Shows Library** (ideal for maintaining your *xbmc* library). Movies and TV Shows are easily organized by your xbmc if they're given the right name.
#### Why do I do it?
This boosts my frequently updated massive media library organised almost instantly.
#### What's New !
* `[ADDED]` Fallback mode if unable to detect a TV Show.
* `[ADDED]` Automatic Subtitle Downloader.
* `[UPDATE]` Uses **imDB** to retrieve the most relevent movie and series names.
